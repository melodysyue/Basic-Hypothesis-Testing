## Basic hypothesis testing

##### Learning goals:
* assumption testing (normality and homogeneity)  
* parametric test vs. non-parametric test
* compare means: one-sample t test vs its non-parametric equivalents (sign test and wilcoxon sign rank test)
* compare means: paired t test vs its non-parametric equivalents (Sign test and Wilcoxon sign rank test)
* compare means: unpaired t test vs its non-parametric equivalent (Wilcoxon rank sum test)
* compare multiple means: anova vs. Kruskal-Wallis test
* compare proportions between two groups
* basic R functions to conduct hypothesis testing
